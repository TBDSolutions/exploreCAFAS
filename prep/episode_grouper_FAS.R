## Episode Grouper for CAFAS速

## Rationale: ##################################################################
#
# The current dataset includes an episode number,  which is generated when an 
# employee activates a case in the FAS system, while initial assessment may 
# occur later for multiple reasons (e.g. no-show, rescheduling, etc.). It is 
# therefore more accurate to use initial assessment date as start, since the 
# assessment serves as the first step of service provision.
#
# An additional inconsistency occurs regarding episodes during which children 
# transition, or 'age out' of the PECFAS速 tool and workers begin to use the 
# CAFAS速 tool instead.  When this occurs, some workers complete an 'initial 
# CAFAS速', rather than continuing same episode, and thereby create a new episode 
# identifier. There is also inconsistent practice around combining episodes that 
# occur within 90 days.
#
# In order to consistently define treatment episodes for measuring outcomes and 
# other features of clinical treatment, there needs to be a consistent definition 
# of a treatment episode. 
#
# This logic assumes that the dataframe passed into this function: 
# (a) includes all historical PECFAS and CAFAS data for each child, 
# (b) is formatted/processed in the same way as output from 'readCAFAS.R' script
#

# Create consistent episode groupings that span PECFAS and CAFAS 
# Caveat: Comparisons between baseline and update score using mixed episodes are
# less likely to show improvement, since PECFAS has a max score of 210, while 
# CAFAS has a max score of 240.
